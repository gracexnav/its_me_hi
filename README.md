# Project - It's Me, Hi!

## Overview
This website is like a portfolio. I created a collection of webpages each dedicated to an area. The Home page consists of all the pages. The skills page is used to list my skills and areas of interest. The book page is like my personal list of all the books I've read not considering academic books. The profile page consists of links to my socials and a brief introduction. The art page consists of zines that I created recently. Finally, my article page consists of articles I wrote with my friend. 

### The Design Choices
#### The Home Page:
I was inspired by an youtube video to create a webpage. I thought of going for an unconventional design. I am not perfectly satisfied, but I think I did way better considering this to be my first website. 
**Some challenges**:
- Animating the waves.
- I thought of introducing dark mode when the sun icon is clicked, but the design was not easy to adapt for dark mode. So, didn't do dark mode.

#### The Skills Page:
The skills vary a lot from person to person. It reminded me of color palettes. So, the page is inspired by that. Getting the correct rotation and position was easier than I thought. The design is simple, but I fell like there is a lot of empty space.

#### The Book Page:
I designed this page last and I can see that my design improved a lot. I got inspiration to use a grid background while going through pinterest. This was the easiest to code. But listing the books I've read was the hard part. 

#### The Profile Page:
This page again has a very simple design. I used an image I created with Canva to use as banner. I did not repeat the image along y axis to make the text readable. 

#### The Art Page:
This page looks elegant. But, it would be better if we could use something that is more responsive friendly for background. This is the only page I used Bootstrap for. I could not make the subpages responsive. You might not be able to view it properly on a mobile phone.

#### The Articles Page:
This is a very simple page. But I think the design could've been improved a lot. I made the background pattern in canva. 

## Final Thoughts:
- Make the design first using an app like Figma. I had a hard time for the home page as I jumped straight into coding.
- Code with responsiveness in mind. 
- Make sure the design is adaptable for other colour palettes and devices.
- Doing the code from scratch is great if you have time. Else use frameworks like Bootstrap.
- I think these amount of pages would be more difficult if javascript is required. I went with a portfolio as it does not require JS and at the same time I can do many pages for practising Html and CSS.
- I did not use the standard folder names like assets etc.. File management comes handy for larger projects. It would be better to use standard naming systems in the future projects.
