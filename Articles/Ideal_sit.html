    <h1>An Ideal Situation</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>He walked in, and I was so shocked by his beauty. He was tall and had golden brown skin. His hair is wavy, and his dimples form when he smiles. The evening sunlight makes his skin smooth. He has an amazing fashion sense. Oh, how I would love to see him in a tailored suit or in a casual shirt. Of course, this did not happen, and this might not happen at all in the future since this is an ideal situation. Ideal things do not exist. But one can hope. So why do people have an ideal type?</p>
    <p>Well, let's say that you have eaten all kinds of ice cream flavors, and you have a favorite among those flavors. You fix this flavor as your ideal type, and when you eat ice cream next time, you compare it with your ideal type. You like the ice cream you ate if it was closer to your ideal type, or else you would not. I think this is the basic reason why people have ideal types. It helps to keep a standard and compare it. So, what is my ideal type?</p>
    <p>Well, Tall, black wavy hair, golden brown skin, brown eyes, fashionable (having dimples is a bonus point), serious but has a pinch of cuteness (Disclaimer: I am not describing a dish). This is just one layer of cake, 'Appearance'. There is another layer of cake called 'personality'. Being considerate is a must, a good listener, and gives respect, and of course, is sincere. That's all I ask. If he is smart, then it will be the cream that finishes the cake. If he can sing well or has a deep voice, then it would be the chocolate on the cake. I would like to eat *cough* … sorry, wrong word; I would like to meet such a fine person if he exists.  What is your ideal type, Jill? </p>
    <p>It's my turn right , haa i dont know where to start actually, ok imagine you are sitting in your classroom amidst everyone and talking to your friends. There is a person who is very quiet and an ordinary normal person, nothing interesting, but that made me look at him. I am usually drawn to introverts although I am not entirely sure why. Maybe I'm drawn to introverts because I'm an extrovert who loves to talk and share my thoughts, and having someone listen attentively makes me feel comfortable and understood.</p>
    <p>More than a partner, I'm looking for someone who can be my best friend - someone with whom I can share every thought, feeling, and experience without fear of judgment. Even with all this without love how can this be end?? Different people will have different perspectives. For me, love is not just a feeling, but a choice rooted in understanding and connection. It's about loving someone for who they are. It's about knowing someone's true nature, imperfections and all, and choosing to love and accept them unconditionally.</p>
    <p>Finally, I yearn for a partner who will accept me wholeheartedly, flaws and all, and will stand to give me company in every aspect, like traveling to different places, exploring new things, and whatnot…</p>
    <p>I totally agree with you Jill, on your take on love and companionship. I believe that only with understanding and unconditional acceptance can one love truly. Even with friends, only when you understand them and unconditionally accept them, friendship bloom.</p>
    <p>Ideal types like most ideal things don't exist in real life. It's all imagination and that's what makes it even more fun. Should we just look for a person who is like our ideal type? I think no. Because even if you meet such a person you might not feel anything. You will like a person due to many reasons and sometimes it's due to circumstances, incidents and even just your dummy heart. I would like to describe liking a person is like gravitating towards that person no matter how you run against it.</p>
    <p><i>'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder'</i>, some might not even care about you, and some others might hold you with such beauty and awe as if you might break. It all depends on the beholder. Choose your beholder well (advice from someone who has zero experience).</p>
    <p>If you look in the mirror today, admire yourself. I do that all the time, and it does not cause me any harm. It just makes me feel happy and confident. You can be the beholder who admires yourself. <i>So why do we have ideal types? Well, it's just fun. What is your ideal type? And what is your take on love?</i></p>
