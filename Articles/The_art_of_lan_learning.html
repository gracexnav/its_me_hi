    <h1>The art of falling for a language</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Hi I am Jack and my friend here is Jill. We decided to torture the internet with our opinions and ideas about books, movies and…. well everything. Here is a place to find goofy writings and interesting things. Do accompany us on this journey of learnings and musings. We have planned for very exciting things to come. We hope you are just as excited to read our releases on every sunday. Then on to our topic for today….</p>
    <p>Language for me holds a very special place. I guess it does hold different meanings for different people but none less than others. I classify the language learning process into four stages. The falling stage, The obsession stage, The favorite track stage and finally the plateau stage. The names might sound funny but stay with me it will make sense.</p>
    <h2>The Falling Stage</h2>
    <p>The falling stage is the most beautiful stage of language learning. It is a time when a whole new world opens to you. Everything will be rose-tinted. There are two ways people come into this stage: they learn about an interesting culture/ movie that induces them to know more about the language. The other way is when they choose the language, which naturally leads to learning about the culture. Once fallen, cannot rise easily. And most importantly, <i>without falling for a language, you cannot learn and master it</i>i. What do you think Jill?</p>
    <p>Will you all believe if I say learning multiple languages actually improves your cognitive skills? I guess now your mind is tickling to fall. How did you fall for a language, Jack?</p>
    <p> Let me tell you the story of how I fell for Korean. The first time I listened to Korean was through a drama. I was absolutely bored with English dramas. Then I stumbled upon this drama and binged it. Everything in it was new to me then, such as the language, the fashion of people, societal norms, etc.. This gave me a refuge from boredom. Of course, if you ask me whether I still like it, then I have to warn you that my thoughts have changed. The language sounded unnatural at first. Then, after a few episodes, I could hear words. And surprisingly, some words were similar in sound and meaning to words in my mother tongue. This fascinated me and I fell for it. Then came the obsession stage. Can you elaborate for me, Jill?</p>
    <h2>The Obsession Stage</h2>
    <p>This is the phase in which you can accelerate your learning and deepen your connection with the culture. I personally started it with very few things, like listening to music, watching my favorite TV shows and movies. It all started as a single dot, then, unknowingly, day by day, by learning new things, it actually became an art. What I used to do was usually learn some new colloquial expressions or words and use them in my daily routine. The funny thing here is I will just use those words with my mom, who doesn't have any idea, and she used to say don't prattle.</p>
    <p>The most important thing is finding your language buddies, connecting with fellow language learners or with the people who have similar interests to you, and this is how I found my partner, Jack. If you are not hooked on what you learn, you will feel like “biting the bullet”.</p>
    <p>Obsession can even take us down some unusual rabbit holes. Imagine being obsessed with collecting rubber ducks, you would have shelves of them of different sizes, colora, and shapes to create the world's most bizarre rubber duck museum, in a similar way I used to collect some unusual or quirky words, delighted in their meanings or pronunciations, which can even lead to amusing discoveries.</p>
    <p>That's a very interesting take, Jill. Similar to how love goes through the stages of attraction, reality, commitment, etc.. We believe that love for language goes through similar stages. In this stage, you are practically obsessed and want to know everything fast. But the reality is that you cannot say you know someone by just listening to them for a week. You can say the same for language, just because you learn and listen for a week doesn't mean you know everything.</p>
    <p>I would like to put a spin on Jill's idea of collecting a museum of quirky words; Everyone has their museum. For example, I love reading books from a variety of genres. I also love listening to music, so I have different playlists for songs from different languages. So my museum would be books and music. We never feel like working when we spend time in our museums. So what if you learn about your museum in that language? For example, I would try reading books in the language I ardently want to learn.</p>
    <p><i>I would like to pose a question to the readers: What is your museum?</i></p>
    <h2>The Favourite Track Stage</h2>
    <p>Just like you learn about the flaws of a person after you get to know them deeply, you discover the flaws of the language you fell for. This is a very unstable stage. You learn that people who speak the language are not perfect. You will not like certain traditions or societal norms.</p>
    <p> When you accept the language as it is, beyond those flaw,s you come to love it even more. I still don't have the heart to lose my bracelet that I got as a souvenir from my trip, even though it has lost its luster. We decided to name this stage the favorite track stage. Everyone has their favorites playlist. You listen to it on repeat endlessly. Sometimes you might get bored with it and try something new. But you will still love it nonetheless. Some songs get added to it. Some will be deleted from it. During this stage, you listen to the language on repeat, and it becomes a comfort zone. It becomes a part of your routine, a part of you.</p>
    <h2>The Plateau Stage</h2>
    <p>Nothing stays in the excited state, even in science. The atoms cannot sustain an excited state all the time. The boiling water eventually cools down. In this final stage, you reach a stable state. There comes a new appreciation for the language you wanted to learn. When I was learning Korean, I went through all these stages. I almost gave up at times, but I realized that <i>learning a language isn't a running race but a long marathon</i>. It's okay to take a break from it. You will be more energized after the break.</p>
    <p>You might ask, <i>Why go through so much trouble?</i> Well, for that, ask yourself why you love? I love my family and friends because they are a part of me and mirror me in certain thoughts. You want to understand them because they show you a different lens to see the world with. For example, your friend might be stringent with using money. Understanding and seeing from your friend's perspective will help you save money. You appreciate yourself more when you become close with others who appreciate you (I have no evidence though). Similarly, when you learn a language, you get a brand new lens to see the world with, a ton of new opportunities, and a deep appreciation for your mother tongue.</p>
    <p> Finally, I would like to conclude by asking <i>what stage you are in? Did you decide to learn a language?</i></p>
