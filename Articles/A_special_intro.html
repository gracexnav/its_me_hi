    <h1>A Special Introduction</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>We have talked about a number of things. But we have yet to introduce ourselves. So we decided to give an intro to each other this week.</p>
    <p>I first saw Jill when I came as a new admission to class. She was the star of the class. At first I thought we wouldn't be best friends. But we became close over the years. The one character about Jill is that she has a strong will. She is the strongest person I know. We both love solving things. I remember in 7th grade our math teacher would ask students to solve problems on board. And we both were first to volunteer. Our teacher would be like not you guys again. But no one in the class would come forward to solve it except me, my sister and of course Jill. We had our fights and differences as friends usually do, but it made us closer. I grew over the years as a very good person (I think I am a good person) thanks to my friends. Jill would be the logical person of our friend group. But she does like to pick funny fights with another friend in the group. We would all say, 'not another fight'. She is always ready to do new things, even if they are crazy. I remember falling for reading and asking her to try reading, and she did. We would have fun discussing books. She loves her family. She loves solving problems. She loves trying new things. You may think we were complete nerds, but it is only partly true. Of course, we would have lengthy conversations about why dividing by zero will give infinity. But on the other hand we were mischievous.</p>
    <p>I remember several funny incidents. Pranking our friends was a daily routine. One day while getting our dairy sign from our math teacher (because our class teacher was absent) I gave my diary to Jill to get it signed for me too. And he was like 'I will sign only when she comes to get it'. Jill came to give the diary to me and suggested not getting a sign. I just put it in my bag without getting a sign. We both gave him a very hard time before getting it signed. Jill was covering for me. We both had tons of fun that day. Finally when I went to get a sign, he put an autograph saying, 'Since you guys gave me a hard time, I will give you an autograph'. She is funny, loyal and compassionate. She is straight forward. We were competitive. We don't back down from a fight. I always admired Jill because she is strong, smart and humble. She is Jill. How can I not like her?</p>
    <p>She always voices her opinion strongly and clearly. We would always push her to join oratory competitions and debate. When I was having a hard time, she made me feel ok, and I didn't hate studying when I was reading with her. I was always inspired to be strong like her. I had a hard time learning after she switched schools. Learning was not so fun without her. So I had a journey to enjoy learning in my way. She was the sunlight that pushed me to grow a lot. This week's blog may feel boring to others, but it means a lot to me. I would like to thank Jill for being my friend over the years. Of course, our friendship changed over the years, but it is still there as a constant source of happiness for me. Jill, you are amazing. Be yourself. If I can choose a person who will never give up on anything, it would be her.</p>
    <p>"I still remember the day I met my friend in school assembly, surrounded by the chatter of classmates and the echo of the principal's voice. We were just two students among hundreds, unaware that our lives were about to intersect in a profound way. I don't recall what we talked about that first time, but I do remember the spark of connection, the sense of ease and familiarity that seemed to bridge the gap between us. Little did I know that this chance encounter would blossom into a lifelong friendship,  the chaos of young adulthood, and the triumphs and tribulations of life beyond.</p>
    <p>As we delved deeper into each other's lives, we discovered a treasure trove of shared interests and passions. Our curiosity and thirst for adventure became the foundation of our friendship, driving us to explore new horizons together. Jack's words still resonate with me: 'We were the misfits who found our path.' Studying was once a central part of our lives, but it began to lose its appeal. I recall moments of regret, wondering if we had made a mistake by not following the beaten path.</p>
    <p>Ah, Jack - the unsung hero of my life's journey. Where do I even begin to describe this incredible individual? Jack is more than just a friend; she's a kindred spirit, a partner in crime, and a constant source of encouragement. Her infectious enthusiasm and unwavering optimism drew me in from the start, and I'm forever grateful for that. Without Jack, I'd likely be a completely different person - one who's less adventurous, less confident, and less willing to take risks. She's the spark that ignited a fire within me, and I'm so thankful to have her in my life. Jack's presence has been a game-changer, and I can't imagine navigating life's twists and turns without her by my side.</p>
    <p>As I look back on our journey, I'm filled with a sense of wonder and gratitude. From that chance meeting in school assembly to the unbreakable bond we've formed. Here's to many more years of exploring, growing, and making more unforgettable moments with my partner in crime, Jack!</p>
    <p><i>So, to all my friends out there, take a moment to appreciate the incredible people in your life. Let them know how much they mean to you. Share any funniest moment you had with them.</i></p>
