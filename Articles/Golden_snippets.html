    <h1>Golden Snippets</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>The sun's rays made everything gold that day. I heard laughter all around me. My friends were beside me and in front of me. We form a small circle. There is a piece of paper with everyone. Of course, it was drawing class, and the staff didn't care what we were doing. I say, 'Hey! I don't look like that'. Some of my friends said that I totally look like that. It was a cartoonish drawing of me. And thus started the war of drawing funnier and crazier cartoons of our friends. I always remember this period in my life as the golden days.</p>
    <p>Now that I think back on those memories, I was truly carefree. My friends and I would explore every topic that interested us. As I said, it was truly golden. Each day had its surprises and learnings. Wasn't it Jill?</p>
    <p>Let's rewind a bit, back to the small circle of friends drawing comical imaginations. The description of those drawings goes like this:</p>
    <p>Friend 1: Noodles head (nickname). We drew her hair like noodles.</p>
    <p>Friend 2: Bent fingers (nickname). We drew long legs and hands for her to represent a ghost.</p>
    <p>Friend 3: The horrible-looking gorilla face.</p>
    <p>And so on. These drawings were truly some description of us. How we saw each other and how we saw ourselves. I couldn't imagine the cartoon drawn for me as me, but my friends could. They saw me in a different light. I think we drew Jill's eyes so big because she has distinct eyes. Imagine these scenes as part of a film. Let me rewind it even further, do you remember Jill? We used to write some facts about our friends in our diaries. Each of us had a diary, and in that we wrote each other's favorite actor, color, and subject. Some were fascinated that we even had a diary. Now, fast forward a few months, you and I were exchanging diaries. I would write in your diary and you in mine. We would write about interesting things we learnt. You might ask, Why am I playing these old scenes in my head and in this blog? Well, firstly, they are good memories to look at, just like good scenery. And secondly, we wanted to draw our current friends and surprise them. Finally, we wanted to prove a point that drawing cartoons of your friends and posting on the internet is totally worth it!</p>
    <p>Here's why you should draw your friends as cartoons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You can make fun of them</li>
        <li>You can move them to tears (i.e., tears of embarrassment)</li>
        <li>Because you are their friend, and they have to put up with you</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Well, if they start a fight with you because of your drawing, don't blame me. It might be because of your poor drawing skills. Since this is a movie, I would also like to honor you with another golden scene from this time. For this snippet, we have to rewind long before the cartoon scene. It was a Tuesday, and that means we had music class from 3.30 to 4.30 pm in school. In the class, we were preparing for the upcoming performance. I was singing with noodles head. You, Jill, were playing the keyboard. We were all getting lots of corrections from the music teacher. We had so much fun singing and playing. After trying to correct them and focusing for a long time, we forgot to look at the time. It was 4.30 pm. The buses were waiting for us. We ran through the corridors laughing and running out of breath. For those curious about the end, we caught up with the buses. Now it's time for Jill to share her golden snippets.  Wofffff The sounds of laughter fill my mind as I recall drawing all those funny things. Those carefree days taught me the importance of slowing down and cherishing the time we spend with loved ones. Those 5 years of life that we spent together were an absolute reminiscence.</p>

    <p>If we just look back, only those memories are left to rewind, right ?? Do u remember jack we all used to be like a head of the mafia family, we used to participate in every competition, we went to many colleges and schools and even won some prizes, school plays and performances, the rush of adrenaline and sense of accomplishment all swirls in my head.</p>
    <p>Summer days, sun-kissed and carefree, we spent our afternoons riding bicycles, the wind in our hair, and laughter in the air. I remember one friend struggling to find balance, and we all pitched in to help. We held the back of the bike, ran alongside, and cheered her. The sense of camaraderie still warms my heart.</p>
    <p>Remember our school projects, especially the waterfall one? We were so excited to create something amazing, but it didn't quite go as planned. We failed, but that's where the real learning began. We experimented, tried new approaches, and learned from our mistakes. Although we 'wasted' a few periods, as we called it, those moments were invaluable. We developed teamwork, creativity, and critical thinking skills, which have stayed with me to this day.</p>
    <p>As I reflect on those formative years, one person stands out - our incredible math teacher. Without saying anything about him I think this cannot come to an end right jack ?? He didn't just teach us numbers and formulas; His unique approach, clarity, and enthusiasm ignited a curiosity within us, encouraging us to think creatively and explore innovative solutions. They were more than just a teacher. His influence extends beyond the classroom, shaping our problem-solving skills and fueling our passion for learning.</p>
    <p>I have added that final message because it marks the beginning of everything that's followed, and isn't it a wonderful journey?</p>
    <p>Sometimes, some series of events occurs, and for no particular reason, they seem etched in your memory. <i>Some of those scenes are coloured golden, while some others are in black and white, and most others blurred.</i> During these events, you would have been in a calm and happy state of mind to create a golden colored snippet.</p>
    <p>As we live and struggle, everyone has these golden snippets of memories. Never lose them. They are as golden and precious. If you can save a piece of anything from that time to remind you, then save it. For me, it was my journal. When you are struggling, take time and look at these golden snippets. They might just cheer you up and inspire you. <i>What are your golden snippets?</i></p>
