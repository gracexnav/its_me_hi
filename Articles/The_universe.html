    <h1>The Universe: An Infinite Wonder Beyond Imagination</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>CHAPTER 1: CURIOSITY AND MEMORIES</h2>
    <p>Imagine standing on the edge of the known world, peering into an expanse so immense that it challenges the very fabric of our understanding.</p>
    <p>Join us as we delve into the dimensions of the universe, examining how its immensity shapes our understanding and ignites our sense of wonder.</p>
    <p>In the grand orchestra of existence, the universe plays a symphony of astonishing scale and complexity. From the swirling dance of galaxies to the silent drift of distant stars, the cosmos presents a vast, interconnected tapestry that stretches beyond our wildest imaginations.</p>
    <p>“As we are talking about the universe, it reminds me of our school's science exhibition. My classmates and I were initially unsure about the theme for our class display. However, we eventually came up with an innovative idea - to transform our classroom into a scaled-down representation of the entire universe. We decided to suspend our solar system from the ceiling, with the sun at its center. To create a realistic effect, we covered all the windows and sealed any gaps to make the room completely dark. Then, we used LED lights and candles to illuminate the space, simulating the glow of stars and celestial bodies. The result was breathtaking - our classroom was transformed into a mesmerizing universe setup, complete with a glowing solar system and a sense of cosmic wonder.” I added this here because it reminds me of how we mesmerized the universe at that time.</p>
    <p>It doesn't end here. We also added some constellations on our school noticeboard. Constellations, oh yes, has anyone ever had the experience of sitting on their terrace with family or walking alone at night, gazing up at the stars and noticing patterns or shapes formed by groups of stars? If so, please share your experience! These patterns are named constellations, which have been used throughout history for navigation, storytelling, and more.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER 2: BEGINNINGS AND TIME MACHINES</h2>
    <p>I had a glance at the past thanks to you, Jill. The universe is expanding. Expanding as you read, expanding every day. If you go back in time, you can say that the universe must have had a smaller version. And let's go way back to the beginning, the universe was a hot, dense mess. Then something called cosmic inflation happened that caused the universe to expand into a less dense, less hot soup of energy. The quarks, gluons, and particles such as protons began to form. This led to the formation of hydrogen. You would have probably heard that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Then the hydrogen created back would still be around. The hydrogen in your body might be one from the beginning of the universe (Big Bang).<sup>[1]</sup></p>
    <p>“We are not just made of stardust, we are made of the Big Bang and the universe” <sup>[2]</sup></p>
    <p>Doesn't that make you feel significant and insignificant at the same time? I feel significant that a part of me contributed to the universe. I feel insignificant because I am nothing alone. The hydrogen in me alone didn't create the universe. The universe does not care even if you or I disappear tomorrow. So, do whatever you want; the world does not care. But if it becomes a movement, a trend, the world does care because people join together (of course, the universe will still not care because it doesn't have any consciousness). A question might have arisen for you. <i>How did they find that the universe formed that way? It could've been different.</i></p>
    <p> To answer that, let me prompt you with a question: Do you believe in time machines? What if I told you that they learned about the beginning of the universe because they saw the past? You might think I am crazy, but stay with me. Every night when you look at the sky, you are looking at the past. Light takes time to travel. The light from the sun takes eight minutes. So when you look at the sun, you are looking at the past version of the sun. The farther the stars, the longer the light takes. Some are 2 years old, some are a century old. <i>A painting has various colors, at different depths, with different shapes. The night sky is a painting called the universe, with objects from different times in the same frame creating illusions.</i> Considering the scale and beauty of our universe, our problems seem petty, insignificant, and useless.</p>
    <h2>CHAPTER 3: LESSONS FROM THE UNIVERSE</h2>
    <p>We don't know whether the universe is finite or infinite; we have been able to see until a certain distance for a certain time. And that forms our observable universe. We don't know what happened before the Big Bang because the light from it obscures anything beyond.  We still explore the universe that is observable despite being boundless. This gave me an answer to a question I have been plagued with all my life. Let me explain with a story.</p>
    <p>The Prince of Contemplation<sup>[3]</sup> is in an endless landscape obscured by fog everywhere. He can see others moving, but not their landscape. It might be clear to them. But for him, it is not clear. Others keep moving, causing him to feel anxious about making progress. He has limited time but doesn't know where to go. Every day, he wakes up and contemplates the path to take. He thinks, “What if that path leads me to hate life?”, “What if I regret taking that path?”, “What if it's too long?”, “What if it's not interesting?”. And at the end of the day, he decides to think tomorrow. Every day, he is paralysed from making any decisions. What should he do? Which way should he go?</p>
    <p>One day, thinking about this question finally gave me an answer. “We would not know what is beyond the observable universe if we didn't move. Only when we move can we see a different part of the universe”<sup>[4]</sup>. Let's look at an example. When you look around you, you can see up to a certain distance. It forms your view, and beyond that, you can't see. But when you move, a new view comes into your vision. Similarly, the prince of contemplation should take steps that he likes in the view he can see. And once he moves, the path ahead might look clear. The destination doesn't matter as long as every step brings joy and learning. Be brave like Moana<sup>[5]</sup> and find the curiosity in you to explore the unknown.</p>
    <h2>EPILOGUE</h2>
    <p>Some say that fictional worlds are hard to believe. But our universe is the most bizarre and unbelievable world. But here we are, tiny creatures living our lives, and that’s incredible. Follow your curiosity, your universe of interests, even when the future seems boundless.</p>
